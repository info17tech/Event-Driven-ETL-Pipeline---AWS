This project demonstrates an event-driven ETL pipeline on AWS using S3, Lambda, Glue, CloudWatch and Athena. The pipeline is designed to automatically process incoming data files, transform them into an optimized format, and make them queryable for analytics and reporting.  The goal is to showcase how serverless components on AWS can be used to build a scalable, automated, and cost-effective data engineering solution.
